                The use of endoscope in otological surgery provides many benefits in terms of visibility
                and access to the operating region but needs to be handled by the surgeon at all time
                making such surgeries cumbersome. A mechanism that can act as an assistant to the
                surgeon for manipulating endoscope can have a huge positive impact on the efficiency of
                the surgeon and the surgeries.
                This thesis explains the technical requirements, constraints and optimization process
                for proposing a mechanism for such application. The importance of analysis and synthesis
                of the kinematic properties of the structure for an optimized output is highlighted in the
                study. The author presents a novel implementation of an optimization algorithm for
                the design optimization. Various approaches researched in the past for the optimization
                are presented and their advantages and disadvantages are pointed out too. The effect
                of parametrization, different constraints as well as rewarding strategies are discussed to
                stress the complexities in the optimization of closed loop kinematic chains. The thesis
                also presents approaches used to consider the constraints for the passive joint limits as
                well as avoiding internal collision in the mechanism. A novel methodology is used for
                a faster and efficient global search of the optimization space. The work concludes by
                presenting the optimised result as well as by discussing open questions regarding the
                future of mechanism design.
