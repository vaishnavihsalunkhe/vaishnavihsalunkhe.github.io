                In otolaryngologic surgery, endoscopy is increasingly used to provide a better view of
                hard-to-reach areas
                and to promote minimally invasive surgery. However, the need to manipulate the endoscope
                limits
                the
                surgeon's ability to operate with only one instrument at a time. Currently, several robotic
                systems are
                being developed, demonstrating the value of robotic assistance in microsurgery. The aim of
                this
                literature
                review is to present and classify current robotic systems that are used for otological and
                endonasal
                applications. For these solutions, an analysis of the functionalities in relation to the
                surgeon's needs
                will be carried out to produce a set of specifications for the creation of new robots.

                In this paper, a kinematic motion planning algorithm for cooperative spatial payload
                manipulation is
                presented. A hierarchical approach is introduced to compute realtime collision-free motion
                plans
                for a
                formation of mobile manipulator robots. Initially, collision-free configurations of a
                deformable
                2-D virtual
                bounding box are identified, over a planning horizon, to determine a convex workspace for
                the
                entire system.
                Then, 3-D payload configurations whose projections lie within the convex workspace are
                computed.
                Finally, a
                convex decentralized model-predictive controller is formulated to plan collision-free
                trajectories for the
                formation of mobile manipulators. Our work facilitates real-time motion planning for the
                system
                and is
                scalable in the number of robots. The algorithm is validated in simulated dynamic
                environments.

                Parallel manipulators are being used extensively to cater to the needs of a multitude of
                industrial
                automation applications. Due to its kinematic accuracy and structural stiffness, parallel
                manipulators have
                proven considerable advantage over their serial counterparts. In modern applications, humans
                train,
                collaborate and interact with the manipulators in order to maximize the productivity and the
                quality of the
                final product. The critical factor in this human-robot interaction is safety and the ability
                of
                the
                mechanism to comply with human intentions. It thus becomes a necessity for the manipulator
                to
                detect
                external disturbances and interactions, and be able to react accordingly. In this research,
                a
                methodology
                for sensor-less full body active compliance is proposed on a 6-DOF RSS
                (Rotary-Spherical-Spherical) parallel
                manipulator. By using the proposed approach, the manipulator can detect and comply with the
                external forces
                on any part of its body without using any explicit force/torque sensor at the joint or the
                end-effector.
                This is done by utilizing the estimated joint torque based on the actuator current feedback
                only. A
                three-layer cascaded impedance controller for active compliance and reaction to various
                human
                interactions
                are reported. The proposed design and unique methodology for compliance exhibits an
                effective
                and
                inexpensive yet reliable alternative to be used in safe human-robot interactions and force
                controlled
                manufacturing applications.

                Parallel manipulators are widely used in the industries for several applications. Due to its
                precision in
                motion as well as its robustness, parallel manipulators have proved its advantage over
                serial
                manipulators.
                In this paper, a 3DOF parallel manipulator is presented and force control of the manipulator
                is
                demonstrated. The proposed manipulator uses a direct drive voice coil arc actuators to
                achieve
                compliance
                required for human-robot interaction or soft mechanical manipulations. Its implementation in
                the
                proposed
                delta manipulator is discussed in the paper. The paper has discussed a unique method of
                controlling position
                as well as the force at the end-effector of the delta manipulator. The method used in making
                the
                manipulator
                compliant does not need an explicit force sensor and is convenient to implement. The method
                is
                inexpensive
                and works satisfactorily in a human interactive environment which is demonstrated through
                experiments
                discussed in the paper. The proposed design finds its application in robot-assisted
                assembly,
                surface
                finishing, cooperative manipulation, haptics etc.
