                In this chapter, a new optimization methodology for parallel kinematic manipulator (PKM)
                is
                proposed, addressing constraints related to singularities, passive joint limits, and
                self-collisions. The proposed optimization approach combines a local search method
                (Nelder-Mead algorithm) with global search methodologies such as low discrepancy
                distribution.
                This combination allows for faster and more efficient exploration of the optimization
                space.
                The algorithm optimizes a global kinematic quality along with the length of the
                prismatic
                actuators. The design constraints can be introduced modularly. This allows for a better
                understanding of the impact of specific criteria on the final result. The chapter also
                discusses
                the effect of the dimension of the search space. It is shown that initial knowledge on
                PKM can
                help reduce the dimension of the search space and result in more intuitive results. The
                presented approach is applied to optimize a PKM with a motion constraint generator of 2
                degrees
                of freedom. This case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology
                in
                addressing the challenges associated with the optimization of PKMs. <br>
