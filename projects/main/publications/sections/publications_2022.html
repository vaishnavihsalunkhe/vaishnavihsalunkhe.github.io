                Cuspidal robots are robots with at least two inverse kinematic solutions that can be
                connected
                by a
                singularity-free path. Deciding the cuspidality of generic 3R robots has been studied in the
                past, but
                extending the study to six-degree-of-freedom robots can be a challenging problem. Many
                robots
                can be modeled
                as a polynomial map together with a real algebraic set so that the notion of cuspidality can
                be
                extended to
                these data. In this paper we design an algorithm that, on input a polynomial map in n
                indeterminates, and s
                polynomials in the same indeterminates describing a real algebraic set of dimension d,
                decides
                the
                cuspidality of the restriction of the map to the real algebraic set under consideration.
                Moreover, if D and
                <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&#964</span> are, respectively the
                maximum
                degree and the
                bound on the bit size of the coefficients of the input polynomials, this algorithm runs in
                time
                log-linear
                in <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">&#964</span> and polynomial in
                ((s+d)D)O(n2). It
                relies on many high-level algorithms in computer algebra which use advanced methods on real
                algebraic sets
                and critical loci of polynomial maps. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm that
                tackles the
                cuspidality problem from a general point of view.

                Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution (IKS) to another without
                meeting
                a
                singularity. This property can be analyzed by understanding the inverse kinematic model
                (IKM) as
                well as the
                singularities in the joint space and in the workspace. In this article, we revisit the
                geometrical
                interpretation of the IKM with conics. The conditions of getting different conics and their
                implication on
                singularities are discussed and the observations regarding the nature of the conics are
                presented. Further,
                a sufficient condition for a 3R robot to be binary (i.e. with up to 2 IKS) as well as
                quaternary
                (i.e. with
                up to 4 IKS) is put forth by analyzing the geometrical interpretation of the IKM. The
                possibility to derive
                a necessary and sufficient condition is presented too.

                Cuspidal robots can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without meeting a
                singularity.
                The name cuspidal was coined based on the existence of a cusp point in the workspace of 3R
                serial robots. The existence of a cusp point was proved to be a necessary and sufficient
                condition for
                orthogonal robots to be cuspidal, but it was not possible to extend this condition to
                non-orthogonal robots. The
                goal of this paper is to prove that this condition stands for any generic 3R serial robot.
                This result would
                give the designer more flexibility. In the presented work, the geometrical interpretation of
                the inverse
                kinematics of 3R robots is revisited and important observations on the nonsingular change of
                posture are
                noted. The paper presents a theorem regarding the existence of reduced aspects in any
                generic 3R serial
                robot. Based on these observations and on this theorem, we prove that the existence of a
                cusp point is a
                necessary and sufficient condition for any 3R generic robot to be cuspidal.

                The optimization of parallel kinematic manipulators (PKM) involve several constraints that
                are
                difficult to
                formalize, thus making optimal synthesis problem highly challenging. The presence of passive
                joint limits as
                well as the singularities and self-collisions lead to a complicated relation between the
                input
                and output
                parameters. In this article, a novel optimization methodology is proposed by combining a
                local
                search,
                Nelder–Mead algorithm, with global search methodologies such as low discrepancy distribution
                for
                faster and
                more efficient exploration of the optimization space. The effect of the dimension of the
                optimization
                problem and the different constraints are discussed to highlight the complexities of
                closed-loop
                kinematic
                chain optimization. The work also presents the approaches used to consider constraints for
                passive joint
                boundaries as well as singularities to avoid internal collisions in such mechanisms. The
                proposed algorithm
                can also optimize the length of the prismatic actuators and the constraints can be added in
                modular fashion,
                allowing to understand the impact of given criteria on the final result. The application of
                the
                presented
                approach is used to optimize two PKMs of different degrees of freedom.

                The use of an endoscope in otological surgery as compared to using a microscope provides
                many
                benefits in
                terms of visibility and access to the operating region. The disadvantage of using an
                endoscope
                is that it
                has to be handled by the surgeon during the surgery. A novel parallel kinematic mechanism
                has
                been proposed
                recently for manipulating the endoscope during surgery. This paper details the design
                requirements
                considered for the optimization of the process, after consulting surgeons with various
                expertise.
                The paper further presents the different evaluation strategies that can be used to optimize
                the
                design
                parameters as per the needs of the application. The contribution of the presented work is
                the
                implementation
                of the surgeons’ requirements into an objective function and the optimization of a proposed
                architecture of
                a parallel kinematic mechanism suitable for otological surgery.

                In otolaryngologic surgery, endoscopy is increasingly used to provide a better view of
                hard-to-reach areas
                and to promote minimally invasive surgery. However, the need to manipulate the endoscope
                limits
                the
                surgeon's ability to operate with only one instrument at a time. Currently, several robotic
                systems are
                being developed, demonstrating the value of robotic assistance in microsurgery. The aim of
                this
                literature
                review is to present and classify current robotic systems that are used for otological and
                endonasal
                applications. For these solutions, an analysis of the functionalities in relation to the
                surgeon's needs
                will be carried out to produce a set of specifications for the creation of new robots.
