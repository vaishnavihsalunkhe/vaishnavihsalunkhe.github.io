                The kinematics of cuspidal 3R regional robots was studied extensively in the past. Moreover,
                certain
                industrial 6R robots were found to be cuspidal (e.g. Fanuc CRX series, Kinova GEN2), which
                makes
                cuspidal
                robots finally interesting for practical applications. This necessitates optimal trajectory
                planning,
                respecting the dynamics and technical limits of the particular robot. In this paper, a
                method
                for singularity-free
                time-optimal point-to-point trajectory (PtP) trajectory planning is proposed. As a special
                case,
                this method
                is applicable to time optimal singularity-free assembly mode changing. Results are shown for
                3R
                robots and
                a 6R FANUC CRX10iA/L.

                A cuspidal serial robot can travel from one inverse kinematic solution to another without
                crossing a
                singularity. Cuspidal robots ask for extra care and caution in trajectory planning, as
                identifying an aspect
                related to one unique inverse kinematic solution is not possible. The issues related to
                motion
                planning with
                cuspidal robots are related to the inherent property arising from the geometric design of
                the
                robot. The
                cuspidality property has not been considered in recent industrial 6R robots with a
                non-spherical
                wrist. In
                this work, cuspidality is illustrated with the JACO robot (gen 2, non-spherical wrist), a
                serial
                arm by
                Kinova Robotics which is deployed in various applications and is cuspidal in nature. A
                nonsingular change
                of solutions for the robot is provided to highlight the effect of cuspidal robots on the
                interference with
                the environment. The pose with multiple inverse kinematic solutions in an aspect is
                presented.
                Problems in choosing the initial solution of the path in cuspidal robots, and its
                consequence,
                is
                illustrated with an example path in the workspace of the JACO robot. The paper presents the
                importance of
                cuspidality analysis of 6R robots and the implications of neglecting it.
