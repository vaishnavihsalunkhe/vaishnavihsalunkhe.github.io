                Cuspidal robots are robots that have at least one connected region with multiple inverse
                kinematic solutions. This allows cuspidal robots to change solutions without crossing
                singularites. This doctoral thesis presents theoretical study on the cuspidal analysis of 3
                revolute jointed (3R) serial robots. The thesis also presents identification algorithms to
                decide cuspidality of generic 6R robots. Later, the application of cuspidality is presented
                by discussing issues and developing a trajectory planning framework of cuspidal commercial
                robots. A closure to the conjecture in 3R cuspidal robots is provided as a result of the
                presented work, and the question on number of aspects in generic 3R robot is concluded. A
                proof for the existence of reduced aspects for a generic 3R robot is presented too. A
                presented proof on cuspidality in 6R robots is reinvestigated, and the need of attention to
                the topic of cuspidality in path planning is further motivated. The critical issues existing
                in commercial 6R robots that are largely ignored are shown, and a path planning framework
                for their mitigation is presented.
