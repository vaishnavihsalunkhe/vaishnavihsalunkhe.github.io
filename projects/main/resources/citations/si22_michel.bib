    abstract = { In otolaryngologic surgery, more and more robots are being studied to meet the clinical needs of operating rooms. However, to help design and optimize these robots, the workspace must be precisely defined taking into account patient variability. The aim of this work is to define a geometric atlas of the middle ear and paranasal sinuses for endoscopic robotic applications. Scans of several patients of different ages and sexes were used to determine the average size of these workspaces, which are linked by the similar use of endoscopes in surgery. }
