        buzzword: design <br><br>
        I have worked extensively on design of parallel manipulators used for
        force compliance, manufacturing as well as surgical applications. I was involved in multi
        robot design for mobile manipulation and quadrotors during my initial years of research. I currently
        work on design of serial manipulators, especially manipulators that are cuspidal.

        buzzword: control <br><br>
        worked on several projects involving control for passive compliance as well as active compliance in
        parallel manipulators. Previous projects include design and control of quadrotor, multi-robot mobile
        manipulation. Currently working on time optimal trajectory planning of cuspidal robots.

        buzzword: cuspidal robots <br><br>
        Cuspidal robots have multiple inverse kinematic solutions (IKS) in a singularity free region,
        aspect.This property can affect path planning safety if overlooked. My PhD focused on the theoretical analysis,
        classification,
        and application of cuspidality in 6R serial robots. Currently investigating redundant cuspidal robots.
