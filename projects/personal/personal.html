                        I have studied in six different cities across three different states in India.

                        philosophy.
                        I fancy the idea of considering myself as an enthusiast of philosophy. <br>
                        I have always been active in my personal life and have played numerous sports like Cricket,
                        Volleyball, Kabaddi, Football, Basketball, Swimming, Squash, Athletics and Boxing.
                        I am currently training in the art of

                        not only the body but also the mind. In indoor games, I am a passionate follower of Chess and
                        have played in various tournaments.<br>
                        Unfortunately, I had a bad fall during bouldering in Aug 2023, and the period after that was
                        quite challenging. I am still recovering and thus the only fun thing I do is <a

                        from time to time, and was taking dance classes. I love to meet
                        people from all corners of the world and my academic endeavours have blessed me with
                        many interesting encounters. I get super excited to hear from people about their culture, their
                        background and how it grooms one's way of life. <br><br>
                        I also like to solve <a href="https://chesstempo.com/chess-tactics/" target="_blank"><span

                        mathematics
                        and this has helped me a lot in my academics. I strongly believe that the great shift from
